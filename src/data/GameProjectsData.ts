    I led the design and development of a cozy point-and-click game called <strong>Good Soup</strong> where you play as a mischievous ghost, influencing the life of Amber, a culinary student. I built a behavior tree system that drives Amberâ€™s actions, where player interactions directly impact the branches she follows. Your choices dynamically affect her mood, alter her decisions, and unlock different story outcomes.

<strong>Good Soup</strong> went through four key development milestones: a "Core Mechanics" whitebox, followed by alpha, beta, and gold iterations. Each release was thoroughly playtested, and I worked to integrate as much feedback as possible, with a focus on refining mechanics, game feel, intuitiveness, and art assets.

        I led the design and development of a narrative puzzle game over 6 weeks. I programmed many systems for the game and built a one-of-a-kind radio controller using an Arduino. I worked alongside a diverse team of six students: software engineers, artists, narrative writers. <strong>Lost in the Static</strong> was presented at the <a href="https://accad.osu.edu/outreach">2024 ACCAD Open House</a> as an example of some of the best work being done in the department.
