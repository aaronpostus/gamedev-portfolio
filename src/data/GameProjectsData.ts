    I led the design and development of a cozy point-and-click game where you play as a mischievous ghost, influencing the life of Amber, a culinary student. I built a behavior tree system that drives Amberâ€™s actions, where player interactions directly impact the branches she follows. Your choices dynamically affect her mood, alter her decisions, and unlock different story outcomes.

        I led the design and development of a narrative puzzle game over 6 weeks. I programmed many systems for the game and built a one-of-a-kind radio controller using an Arduino. I worked alongside a diverse team of six students: software engineers, artists, narrative writers. Lost in the Static was presented at the <a href="https://accad.osu.edu/outreach">2024 ACCAD Open House</a> as an example of some of the best work being done in the department.

I created a Minecraft plugin using Java that transforms a multiplayer server into a recreation of the mobile game Clash of Clans. Players can build their own island, attack offline players' bases, and collect resources.
